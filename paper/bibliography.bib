	abstract = {Climate change and increased urban population are two major concerns for society. Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.},

	abstract = {Cities are not only major contributors to global climate change but also stand at the forefront of climate change impact. Quantifying and assessing the risk potentially induced by climate change has great significance for cities to undertake positive climate adaptation and risk prevention. However, most of the previous studies focus on global, national or regional dimensions, only a few have attempted to examine climate change risk at an urban scale and even less in the case of a recent literature review. As a result, a quantitative assessment of climate change risk for cities remains highly challenging. To fill this gap, the article makes a critical review of the recent literature on urban-scale climate change risk assessment, and classifies them into four major categories of studies which jointly constitute a stepwise modelling chain from global climate change towards urban-scale risk assessment. On this basis, the study summarizes the updated research progresses and discusses the major challenges to be overcome for the seamless coupling of climate simulation between different scales, the reproduction of compound climate events, the incorporation of non-market and long-lasting impacts and the representation of risk transmission insides or beyond a city. Furthermore, future directions to advance quantitative assessment of urban-scale climate change risk are highlighted, with fresh insights into improving study methodology, enriching knowledge of climate change impact on city, enhancing abundance and accessibility to data, and exploring the best practice to provide city-specific climate risk service.},

	abstract = {The spatial resolution of energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) is often compromised for computational performance. Reducing the spatial resolution impacts the least-cost solutions when optimising the generation capacity and transmission capacity of the ESOMs with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources. Previous studies show that the two main effects of spatial resolution reduction are the increase in solar and wind expansion capacity and the decrease in transmission capacity expansion. This paper introduces a targeted method of defining regions during spatial scale reduction by using the max-p-regions clustering algorithm to aggregate similar areas into regions. The attributes used to determine the similarity between areas in the max-p-regions method are population; wind and solar resource potential; and pumped-hydro storage capacity. Two alternative spatial resolution reduction methods were used to compare how the effects of spatial resolution impacted the optimisation results of the ESOMs. Evaluation results for three country groups showed that using the max-p-regions method to define regions caused the two effects of spatial resolution reduction to be generally lower than using national jurisdictions. For the case studies Germany and Spain, the results showed that the max-p-regions method identified sets of regions, which were less impacted by the two effects of spatial resolution reduction.},

This study aimed to assess the risk of heatwave-related mortality and evaluate the health risk-based definition of heatwave. We collected data on daily temperature and mortality from 229 districts in South Korea in 2011–2017. District-specific heatwave-related mortality risks were calculated using a distributed lag model. The estimates were pooled in the total areas and for each urban and rural area using meta-regression. In the total areas, the threshold point of heatwave mortality risk was estimated at the 93rd percentile of temperature, and it was lower in urban areas than in rural areas (92nd percentile vs. 95th percentile). The maximum risk of heatwave-related mortality in the total area was 1.11 (95\% CI: 1.01–1.22), and it was slightly greater in rural areas than in the urban areas (RR: 1.23, 95\% CI: 0.99–1.53 vs. RR: 1.10, 95\% CI: 1.01–1.20). The results differ by age- and cause-specific deaths. In conclusion, the patterns of heatwave-related mortality risk vary by area and sub-population in Korea. Thus, more target-specific heatwave definitions and action plans should be established according to different areas and populations.},

	abstract = {Neighborhood delineation is increasingly relied upon in urban social science research to identify the most appropriate spatial unit. In problems of this type, the true number of neighborhoods (typically called the k parameter) is unknown and analysts often require algorithmic approaches to determine k endogenously. Existing approaches for neighborhood delineation that do not require pre-specification of a k-parameter, however, are either nonspatial or lead to noncontiguous or overlapping regions. In this paper, we propose the use of max-p-regions for neighborhood delineation so that the geographic space can be partitioned into a set of homogeneous and geographically contiguous neighborhoods. In addition, we developed a new efficient algorithm to address the computational challenges associated with solving the max-p-regions so that it can be applied for large-scale neighborhood delineation. This new algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL). Computational experiments based on both simulated and realistic data sets are performed and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

The heat index, which measures how the temperature actually feels on the body, would hit 126 degrees by the time the day was over. Meteorologists had been warning residents about a two-day heat wave, but these temperatures did not end that soon. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; the records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. And by July 20, over seven hundred people had perished-more than twice the number that died in the Chicago Fire of 1871, twenty times the number of those struck by Hurricane Andrew in 1992—in the great Chicago heat wave, one of the deadliest in American history.

Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a "social autopsy," examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been},

Many electric utilities, however, contend that the growth of customer-owned, distributed solar energy systems will create costs that the utilities must pass on to ratepayers. This debate has led to a wide range of technical reports seeking to quantify the costs and benefits of solar energy to electric utilities, ratepayers, and society at large. We review these studies, discuss the different perspectives that they represent, and identify the key variables that have shaped this value-of-solar debate.

	abstract = {Rising renewable shares influence electricity markets in several ways: among others, average market prices are reduced and price volatility increases. Therefore, the “missing money problem” in energy-only electricity markets is more likely to occur in systems with high renewable shares. Nevertheless, renewables are supported in many countries due to their expected benefits. The kind of support instrument can however influence the degree to which renewables influence the market. While fixed feed-in tariffs lead to higher market impacts, more market-oriented support schemes such as market premiums, quota systems and capacity-based payments decrease the extent to which markets are affected. This paper analyzes the market impacts of different support schemes. For this purpose, a new module is added to an existing bottom-up simulation model of the electricity market. In addition, different degrees of flexibility in the electricity system are considered. A case study for Germany is used to derive policy recommendations regarding the choice of support scheme.},

It identifies limitations in capacity to reflect the dynamic nature of risk components, and the need for standardisation and refinement of methods used to quantify evolving risk patterns. Recent studies highlight the changing nature of hazards, exposure and vulnerability, the three components of risk, and demonstrate the need for coordinated guidance on strategies and methods that better reflect the dynamic nature of the components themselves, and their interaction. Here, we discuss limitations of a static risk framework and call for a way forward that will allow for a better understanding and description of risk. Such advancements in conceptualisation are needed to bring closer the understanding and description of risk in theory with how risk is quantified and communicated in practice. To stimulate discussion, this article proposes a formulation of risk that clearly recognises the temporally evolving nature of risk components.},

	abstract = {Single-family residential rooftop solar adoption in the United States has not occurred equitably across the country, nor across socioeconomic and demographic groups. In response, state and local governments have developed solar equity programs, primarily focused on increasing adoption by low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. This study merged national datasets that estimate rooftop solar potential, the distribution of rooftop solar systems, and census tract- level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to answer three questions. First, how are spatial distributions of rooftop potential and penetration similar and different across cities? Second, how is rooftop penetration distributed across non-LMI and LMI communities in different cities? Third, how do the relationships between rooftop penetration and local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, identified as barriers to solar adoption, differ? Using GIS, bivariate and multivariate analyses, these questions were examined in four US cities – Riverside and San Bernardino, California, Washington, DC, and Chicago, Illinois – to understand both universal and distinct local manifestations. Findings include: higher rooftop potential existed in some LMI communities; higher rooftop potential did not necessarily translate to higher rooftop penetration, especially if higher potential was in LMI communities; and beyond income, other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, limited English proficiency, age of housing stock, and internet access were associated with rooftop penetration. While there remains great potential for expanding rooftop solar to LMI households and communities, understanding the local dynamics of solar potential and penetration may inform better policy development and implementation.},

While many classification methods have been proposed, there is no consensus on which methods are more suitable for a given dataset. As a consequence, it is important to comprehensively compare methods in many possible scenarios. In this context, we performed a systematic comparison of 9 well-known clustering methods available in the R language assuming normally distributed data. In order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes, separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach tended to present particularly good performance. We also found that the default configuration of the adopted implementations was not always accurate. In these cases, a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms.},

	abstract = {Abstract Urban heat island (UHI) effects can strengthen heat waves and air pollution episodes. In this study, the dampening impact of urban trees on the UHI during an extreme heat wave in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area is examined by incorporating trees, soil, and grass into the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model and an urban canopy model (WRF-UCM). By parameterizing the effects of these natural surfaces alongside roadways and buildings, the modified WRF-UCM is used to investigate how urban trees, soil, and grass dampen the UHI. The modified model was run with 50\% tree cover over urban roads and a 10\% decrease in the width of urban streets to make space for soil and grass alongside the roads and buildings. Results show that, averaged over all urban areas, the added vegetation decreases surface air temperature in urban street canyons by 4.1 K and road-surface and building-wall temperatures by 15.4 and 8.9 K, respectively, as a result of tree shading and evapotranspiration. These temperature changes propagate downwind and alter the temperature gradient associated with the Chesapeake Bay breeze and, therefore, alter the strength of the bay breeze. The impact of building height on the UHI shows that decreasing commercial building heights by 8 m and residential building heights by 2.5 m results in up to 0.4-K higher daytime surface and near-surface air temperatures because of less building shading and up to 1.2-K lower nighttime temperatures because of less longwave radiative trapping in urban street canyons.},

We show that urban trees exhibit lower temperatures than urban fabric across most European cities in summer and during hot extremes. Compared to continuous urban fabric, LSTs observed for urban trees are on average 0-4 K lower in Southern European regions and 8-12 K lower in Central Europe. Treeless urban green spaces are overall less effective in reducing LSTs, and their cooling effect is approximately 2-4 times lower than the cooling induced by urban trees. By revealing continental-scale patterns in the effect of trees and treeless green spaces on urban LST our results highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the climate-dependent effectiveness of heat mitigation measures in cities.},

Tree Census, using an i-Tree Eco assessment, of the sevencounty Chicago region: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake,
McHenry, and Will counties, and the city of Chicago. Using
methodology from the 2007 city of Chicago Urban Forest
Effects (UFORE) model assessment and the 2010 Chicago
region i-Tree assessment, 1,576 plots were resampled and
analyzed to provide insights on a decade of structural and
functional change in the regional forest. Further, values of select
ecosystem benefits were analyzed and estimated. The number
of trees and shrubs increased from 157,142,000 in 2010 to
172,297,000 in 2020, representing more than 194 species.
In 2020, the regional forest tree and shrub canopy cover
was assessed to be 23\%, an increase from 21\% in 2010. In
general, canopy cover increased in six counties, but declined in
the city of Chicago and McHenry County.
Forty-five percent of the tree species found in the region are
considered invasive. The invasive small tree, European buckthorn
(Rhamnus cathartica), has the highest importance value for the
seven-county region. For the city of Chicago, silver maple (Acer
saccharinum) has the highest importance value. Approximately
75\% of the trees and shrubs are smaller than 6 inches in diameter
at breast height (DBH). The regional forest has an estimated
replacement value of \$45 billion and provides more than
\$416 million in annual ecosystem services. Comparing 2010
and 2020, the replacement value of the regional forest has declined
from \$51 billion to \$45 billion.
The 2020 tree census serves as a strategic guide for local and
regional stakeholders to understand the current trends and
make informed decisions on how to protect and improve the
regional forest.},

Here, we use National Agriculture Imagery Program digital ortho photographs to survey the tree cover inequality for Census blocks in US large urbanized areas, home to 167 million people across 5,723 municipalities and other Census-designated places. We compared tree cover to summer land surface temperature, as measured using Landsat imagery. In 92\% of the urbanized areas surveyed, low-income blocks have less tree cover than high-income blocks. On average, low-income blocks have 15.2\% less tree cover and are 1.5⁰C hotter than high-income blocks. The greatest difference between low- and high-income blocks was found in urbanized areas in the Northeast of the United States, where low-income blocks in some urbanized areas have 30\% less tree cover and are 4.0⁰C hotter. Even after controlling for population density and built-up intensity, the positive association between income and tree cover is significant, as is the positive association between proportion non-Hispanic white and tree cover. We estimate, after controlling for population density, that low-income blocks have 62 million fewer trees than high-income blocks, equal to a compensatory value of \$56 billion (\$1,349/person). An investment in tree planting and natural regeneration of \$17.6 billion would be needed to close the tree cover disparity, benefitting 42 million people in low-income blocks.},

The lack of data and information to support the planning process is often mentioned as a factor hampering the adaptation processes in cities. In this paper, we developed and tested a methodology for heat stress vulnerability and risk assessment at the neighborhood scale to support designers, planners, and decision makers in developing and implementing adaptation strategies and measures at the local level. The methodology combines high-resolution spatial information and crowdsourcing geospatial data to develop sensitivity, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, exposure, and risk indicators. The methodology is then tested on the urban fabric of the city of Padova, Italy. Our results show that different vulnerability and risk values correspond to different typologies of urban areas. Furthermore, the possibility of combining high-resolution information provided by the indicators and land use categories is of great importance to support the adaptation planning process. We also argue that the methodology is flexible enough to be applied in different contexts.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric warming is projected to intensify heat wave events, as quantified by multiple descriptors, including intensity, duration, and frequency. While most studies investigate one feature at a time, heat wave characteristics are often interdependent and ignoring the relationships between them can lead to substantial biases in frequency (hazard) analyses. We propose a multivariate approach to construct heat wave intensity, duration, frequency (HIDF) curves, which enables the concurrent analysis of all heat wave properties. Here we show how HIDF curves can be used in various locations to quantitatively describe the likelihood of heat waves with different intensities and durations. We then employ HIDF curves to attribute changes in heat waves to anthropogenic warming by comparing GCM simulations with and without anthropogenic emissions. For example, in Los Angeles, CA, HIDF analysis shows that we can attribute the 21\% increase in the likelihood of a four-day heat wave (temperature {\textgreater} 31 °C) to anthropogenic emissions.},

	abstract = {In our current global warming climate, the growth of record-breaking heat waves (HWs) is expected to increase in its frequency and intensity. Consequently, the considerably growing and agglomerated world’s urban population becomes more exposed to serious heat-related health risks. In this context, the study of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) intensity during HWs is of substantial importance due to the potential vulnerability urbanized areas might have to HWs in comparison to their surrounding rural areas. This article discusses Land Surface Temperatures (LST) reached during the extreme HW over Western North America during the boreal summer of 2021 using Thermal InfraRed (TIR) imagery acquired from TIR Sensor (TIRS) (30 m spatial resolution) onboard Landsat-8 platform and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (1 km spatial resolution) onboard Terra/Aqua platforms. We provide an early assessment of maximum LSTs reached over the affected areas, as well as impacts in terms of SUHI over the main cities and towns. MODIS series of LST from 2000 to 2021 over urbanized areas presented the highest recorded LST values in late June 2021, with maximum values around 50 °C for some cities. High spatial resolution LSTs (Landsat-8) were used to map SUHI intensity as well as to assess the impact of SUHI on thermal comfort conditions at intraurban space by means of a thermal environmental quality indicator, the Urban Field Thermal Variance Index (UFTVI). The same high resolution LSTs were used to verify the existence of clusters and employ a Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) to quantify its degree of strength. We identified the spatial distribution of heat patterns within the intraurban space as well as described its behavior across the thermal landscape by fitting a polynomial regression model. We also qualitatively analyze the relationship between both UFTVI and LST clusters with different land cover types. Findings indicate that average daytime SUHI intensity for the studied cities was typically within 1 to 5 °C, with some exceptional values surpassing 7 °C and 9 °C. During night, the SUHI intensity was reduced to variations within 1–3 °C, with a maximum value of +4 °C. The extreme LSTs recorded indicate no significant influence of HW on SUHI intensity. SUHI intensity maps of the intraurban space evidence hotspots of much higher values located at densely built-up areas, while urban green spaces and dense vegetation show lower values. In the same manner, UTFVI has shown “no” SUHI for densely vegetated regions, water bodies, and low-dense built-up areas with intertwined dense vegetation, while the “strongest” SUHI was observed for non-vegetated dense built-up areas with low albedo material such as concrete and pavement. LST was evidenced as a good marker for assessing the influence of HWs on SUHI and recognizing potential thermal environmental consequences of SUHI intensity. This finding highlights that remote-sensing based LST is particularly suitable as an indicator in the analysis of SUHI intensity patterns during HWs at different spatial resolutions. LST used as an indicator for analyzing and detecting extreme temperature events and its consequences seems to be a promising means for rapid and accurate monitoring and mapping.},

	abstract = {Can community energy help to overcome inequalities in who benefits from low-carbon technologies? Research has shown that the distribution of low-carbon technology subsidies and their associated benefits can be highly uneven across socioeconomic groups, revealing a persistent inequality issue. Yet this research has tended to focus almost exclusively on adoption of technologies at the household-level, with limited insights into whether and how this distribution might differ in the case of community energy. To address this, this paper quantitatively investigates the distribution of payments to household- and community-level energy systems across socioeconomic groups in Scotland under the UK government feed-in-tariff. Analysis is conducted on a novel dataset of 26,218 household and community wind and solar installations across 6,976 micro-level data-zones using a combination of distributional analysis and random effects within-between regression. It finds that feed-in-tariff payments for household-level wind and solar PV systems have heavily benefitted more affluent socioeconomic groups, while payments to community energy projects have flowed more consistently into areas of higher deprivation, particularly in the case of community solar. These findings suggest that community energy has been successful in bringing the benefits of low-carbon technologies to areas of lower income and higher deprivation, with important lessons for policymakers concerned with a just transition going forward.},

The frameworks address the overarching urban conditions of complexity, diffuseness, connectivity, and diversity of cities across the globe. The frameworks also help evaluate how a project or study may advance sustainability. The metacity concept, a spatially scalable representation of mosaic change in urban systems, demonstrates how the frameworks apply to increasingly extensive, spatially heterogeneous, and dynamic urban regions. The metacity concept helps avoid static and isolated plans and management approaches and provides a conceptual foundation for an interdisciplinary urban systems science. The frameworks suggest a practical checklist that may help interventions, strategies, and research better align with goals for transforming urban systems toward sustainability.},

After decades of weatherization and bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts faced by financially constrained households.},

	abstract = {One major avenue for policymakers to meet climate targets is by decarbonizing the power sector, one component of which is raising the share of renewable energy sources (renewables) in electricity generation. However, promoting renewables --in liberalized power markets-- creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100\% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. Ignoring these findings can slow adoption and increase the costs of deploying new renewable technologies. This paper spots the incompatibility between electricity liberalization and renewable policy, regardless of the country, location or renewable technologies. The Paradox holds as long as market clear prices with short term marginal costs, and renewable technology's marginal cost is close to zero and not dispatchable.},

The government of Guatemala has introduced a plan to increase renewable generation capacity, while an estimated 76\% of Guatemalans are energy poor. In this paper, we evaluate the trade-offs between alleviating energy poverty and achieving renewable energy goals in Guatemala. We present a framework that combines an electricity cost model with a household expenditure survey to assess the effects that a national renewable energy development goal could have on energy poverty through added electricity expenditures. We find that the development of new renewable electricity generation has potential to significantly increase tariffs for residential electricity consumers across the country, whereby 80\% of municipalities could experience more than one-third increase in monthly energy expenditures. More importantly, we find that the distribution of impacts will not be equal everywhere: households in the western, rural part of Guatemala that are already energy stressed will likely experience the greatest cost burdens because natural resource availability is low while overall poverty is already high. In addition, we compare the costs of renewable versus fossil fuel development and find that the least-cost policy in Guatemala includes a mix of both renewable and fossil technologies.},

Several studies investigated the influence of individual parameters in the UHI phenomenon, on the other hand, an exhaustive study that quantifies the influence of each parameter in the resulting UHI is missing in the related literature. This paper proposes a new index aimed at quantifying the hazard of the absolute maximum UHI intensity in urban districts during the Summer season by taking all the parameters influencing the phenomenon into account. In addition, for the first time, the influence of each parameter has been quantified. City albedo and the presence of greenery represent the most important characteristics with an influence of 29\% and 21\%. Population density, width of streets, canyon orientation and building height has a medium influence of 12\%, 10\%, 9\% and 8\% respectively. The remaining parameters have an overall influence of 11\%. These results are achieved by exploiting three synergistically related techniques: the Analytic Hierarchy Processes to analyse the parameters involved in the UHI phenomenon; a state-of-the-art technique to acquire a large set of data; and an optimization procedure involving a involving a Jackknife resampling approach to calibrate the index by exploiting the effective UHI intensity measured in a total of 41 urban districts and 35 European Cities.},

	abstract = {A growing literature documents the effects of heat stress on premature mortality and other adverse health outcomes. Urban heat islands (UHI) can exacerbate these adverse impacts in cities by amplifying heat exposure during the day and inhibiting the body’s ability to recover at night. Since the UHI intensity varies not only across, but also within cities, intra-city variation may lead to differential impact of urban heat stress on different demographic groups. To examine these differential impacts, we combine satellite observations with census data to evaluate the relationship between distributions of both UHI and income at the neighborhood scale for 25 cities around the world. We find that in most (72\%) cases, poorer neighborhoods experience elevated heat exposure, an incidental consequence of the intra-city distribution of income in cities. This finding suggests that policymakers should consider designing city-specific UHI reduction strategies to mitigate its impacts on the most socioeconomically vulnerable populations who may be less equipped to adapt to environmental stressors. Since the strongest contributor of intra-urban UHI variability among the physical characteristics considered in this study is a neighborhood’s vegetation density, increasing green space in lower income neighborhoods is one strategy urban policymakers can adopt to ameliorate some of UHI’s inequitable burden on economically disadvantaged residents.},

The selection of articles considered keywords, title, abstract, and when deemed necessary, the full text. The process was conducted by two independent researchers and 579 articles, published in English, were selected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Cfa climate areas are the most represented, as the Northern Hemisphere concentrates the most studied areas, especially in Asia (69.94\%); Landsat products were the most applied to estimates LST (68.39\%) and LULC (55.96\%); ArcGIS (30.74\%) was most used software for data treatment, and correlation (38.69\%) was the most applied statistic technique.

	abstract = {Due to the combined effects of urban growth and climate change, rapid urbanisation is particularly challenging in African cities. Areas that will house a large proportion of the urban population in the future coincide with where natural hazards are expected to occur, and where hazard risk management institutions, knowledge, and capacity are often lacking. One of the challenges posed by rapid urbanisation is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, whereby urban areas are warmer than the surrounding rural areas. This study investigates urbanisation patterns and alterations in surface UHI (SUHI) intensity for the Kampala urban cluster, Uganda. Analyses show that between 1995 and 2017, Kampala underwent extensive changes to its urban built-up area. From the centre of the city to adjoining non-built up areas in all directions, the urban land cover increased from 12,133 ha in 1995 to 25,389 ha in 2016. The area of SUHI intensity in Kampala expanded significantly over the 15-year period of study, expanding from 22,910 ha in 2003 to 27,900 ha in 2016, while the annual daytime SUHI of 2.2°C in 2003 had decreased to 1.9°C by 2017. Although SUHI intensity decreased in some parts of the city, elsewhere it increased, suggesting that urbanisation does not always lead to a deterioration of environmental conditions. We postulate that urban development may therefore not necessarily create an undesirable impact on local climate if it is properly managed. Rapidly growing cities in Africa and elsewhere should ensure that the dynamics of their development are directed towards mitigating potentially harmful environmental impacts, such as UHI effect through careful planning that considers both bluespaces and greenspaces.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study is, therefore, to analyze the formation of the UHIs in eight different cities in arid and semi-arid regions. The analysis is based on land cover (LC) classification (urban, green, and bare areas). The study found that bare areas had the highest mean LST values compared to the urban and green areas. The results show that the difference in temperatures between the bare areas and the urban areas ranges between 1 and 2 °C, between the bare areas and green areas ranges between 1 and 7 °C, and between the urban areas and green areas ranges between 1 and 5 °C. Furthermore, the LST values varied for each of the LULC categories, and hence some areas in the three categories had lower or higher LST values than in other categories. Hence, one category may not always have the highest LST value compared to other categories. The outcomes of this study may, therefore, have critical implications for urban planners who seek to mitigate UHI effects in arid and semi-arid urban areas.},
